			Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five
			sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes
			a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length
			and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly
			journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
